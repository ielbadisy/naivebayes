title: "Sparse Matrices"
---

Starting with the `0.9.7` version from March 2020 four specialized implementations of the Na√Øve Bayes model support sparse matrices:

- `multinomial_naive_bayes()`
- `bernoulli_naive_bayes()`
- `poisson_naive_bayes()` and 
- `gaussian_naive_bayes()`.

All these functions can take advantage of sparsity to possibly speed up the calculations. This can be simply accomplished by providing them with a matrix of class `dgCMatrix` from the excellent `Matrix`^[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Matrix/index.html] package. Addition of this new functionality does not introduce any breaking changes and is also fully compatible with the no-dependency-philosophy of the `naivebayes` project. 

## Usage:

In the example a Multinomial Naive Bayes model is trained using a simulated sparse matrix:


```{r}
# Simulate ~95% sparse matrix
cols <- 10 ; rows <- 100
M <- matrix(sample(0:5, rows * cols, TRUE, prob = c(0.95, rep(0.01, 5))), nrow = rows, ncol = cols)
y <- factor(sample(paste0("class", LETTERS[1:2]), rows, TRUE, prob = c(0.3,0.7)))
colnames(M) <- paste0("V", seq_len(ncol(M)))

# Check fraction of zeros
mean(M == 0)

# Cast the matrix to "dgCMatrix" object
M_sparse <- Matrix::Matrix(M, sparse = TRUE)

### Train the Multinomial Naive Bayes and predict the training data
mnb <- naivebayes::multinomial_naive_bayes(x = M, y = y, laplace = 1)
head(predict(mnb, M_sparse))
```

The classifier and corresponding prediction function automatically recognize the sparse matrix and do not require additional parameters. Note that (dense) matrices are not internally cast into the `dgCMatrix` class - this kind of manipulations have to be explicitly performed by the user.




<!-- Here a section where a rule of thumb is given (for the bigger and more sparse the matrix is the bigger the speed up compared to dense counter-part. There may be some overhead for small sparse matrices.) Poisson Naive Bayes has some overhead and does not scale that well.  -->
